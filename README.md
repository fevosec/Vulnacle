# Vulnacle
A deliberately misconfigured database training appliance

Vulnacle — a deliberately misconfigured database training appliance for security demos and sysadmin hardening workshops.
Use it to demonstrate how common configuration mistakes can be discovered and fixed by defenders — and tested by ethical pentesters — in a controlled, legal, and auditable environment.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Vulnacle is for education, training, and research only. Do not run it on public networks or use it to attack systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. See Legal & Safety below.
