# Vulnacle
A deliberately misconfigured database training appliance

Vulnacle — a deliberately misconfigured database training appliance for security demos and sysadmin hardening workshops.
Use it to demonstrate how common configuration mistakes can be discovered and fixed by defenders — and tested by ethical pentesters — in a controlled, legal, and auditable environment.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Vulnacle is for education, training, and research only. Do not run it on public networks or use it to attack systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. See Legal & Safety below.

# Before you begin
- To download and run Oracle Database, regardless whether inside or outside a container, you must download the binaries from the Oracle website and accept the license indicated at that page.


# Legal, licensing & safety — read carefully

- Do not redistribute vendor binaries unless the vendor license explicitly allows it. This project uses a build-locally approach to avoid redistributing proprietary code.

- Oracle and other vendors have trademark and redistribution rules. If you plan to distribute binary-containing images outside a controlled environment, seek legal review or vendor permission.

- Use only for lawful, authorized testing. Do not use Vulnacle to facilitate unauthorized access or attacks. You are responsible for complying with local laws and organizational policies.

- No offensive tooling included. Vulnacle documents weaknesses and remediation; it does not include exploit code or step-by-step attack recipes.
